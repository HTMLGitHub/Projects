                                        I watch how the moon
                                        Sits in the sky in the dark night
                                        Shining with the light from the sun
                                        And the sun doesn't give light to the moon
                                        assuming
                                        The moon's going to owe it one
                                        It makes me think of how you act to me
                                        You do
                                        Favors then rapidly, you just
                                        Turn around and start asking me about
                                        Things you want back from me
                                        I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
                                        Sick of you acting like I owe you this
                                        Find another place to feed your greed
                                        While I find a place to rest
                                        I want to be in another place
                                        I hate when you say you don't understand
                                        (You'll see it's not meant to be)
                                        I want to be in the energy, 
                                        not with the enemy
                                        A place for my head
                                        Maybe someday I'll be just like you and
                                        Step on people like you do and
                                        Run away all the people I thought I knew
                                        I remember back then who you were
                                        You used to be calm, used to be strong
                                        Used to be generous 
                                        but you should've known
                                        That you'd
                                        Wear out your welcome now you see
                                        How quiet it is all alone
                                        I'm so
                                        Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
                                        Sick of you acting like I owe you this
                                        Find another place to feed your greed

                                        You try to take the best of me
                                        Go away
                                        You try to take the best of me
